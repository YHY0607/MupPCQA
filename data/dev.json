The original use case was to be able to define the methods as class methods or static methods on the head of their definition. Without the decorator syntax, it would require a rather sparse and repetitive definition:<code>class WithoutDecorators:\ndef some_static_method():\n    print(\"this is static method\")\nsome_static_method = staticmethod(some_static_method)def some_class_method(cls):\n    print(\"this is class method\")\nsome_class_method = classmethod(some_class_method)\n</code>If the decorator syntax is used for the same purpose, the code is shorter and easier to understand:<code>class WithDecorators:\n    @staticmethod\n    def some_static_method():\n        print(\"this is static method\")    @classmethod\n    def some_class_method(cls):\n        print(\"this is class method\")\n</code>General syntax and possible implementationsThe decorator is generally a named object ( lambda expressions are not allowed) that accepts a single argument when called (it will be the decorated function) and returns another callable object. \"Callable\" is used here instead of \"function\" with premeditation. While decorators are often discussed in the scope of methods and functions, they are not limited to them. In fact, anything that is callable (any object that implements the _call__ method is considered callable), can be used as a decorator and often objects returned by them are not simple functions but more instances of more complex classes implementing their own __call_ method.The decorator syntax is simply only a syntactic sugar. Consider the following decorator usage:<code>@some_decorator\ndef decorated_function():\n    pass\n</code>This can always be replaced by an explicit decorator call and function reassignment:<code>def decorated_function():\n    pass\ndecorated_function = some_decorator(decorated_function)\n</code>However, the latter is less readable and also very hard to understand if multiple decorators are used on a single function.\nDecorators can be used in multiple different ways as shown below:As a functionThere are many ways to write custom decorators, but the simplest way is to write a function that returns a subfunction that wraps the original function call. The generic patterns is as follows:<code>def mydecorator(function):\n    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\n        # do some stuff before the original\n        # function gets called\n        result = function(*args, **kwargs)\n        # do some stuff after function call and\n        # return the result\n        return result\n    # return wrapper as a decorated function\n    return wrapped\n</code>As a classWhile decorators almost always can be implemented using functions, there are some situations when using user-defined classes is a better option. This is often true when the decorator needs complex parametrization or it depends on a specific state.The generic pattern for a nonparametrized decorator as a class is as follows:<code>class DecoratorAsClass:\n    def __init__(self, function):\n        self.function = function    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # do some stuff before the original\n        # function gets called\n        result = self.function(*args, **kwargs)\n        # do some stuff after function call and\n        # return the result\n        return result\n</code>Parametrizing decoratorsIn real code, there is often a need to use decorators that can be parametrized. When the function is used as a decorator, then the solution is simple—a second level of wrapping has to be used. Here is a simple example of the decorator that repeats the execution of a decorated function the specified number of times every time it is called:<code>def repeat(number=3):\n\"\"\"Cause decorated function to be repeated a number of times.Last value of original function call is returned as a result\n:param number: number of repetitions, 3 if not specified\n\"\"\"\ndef actual_decorator(function):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        result = None\n        for _ in range(number):\n            result = function(*args, **kwargs)\n        return result\n    return wrapper\nreturn actual_decorator\n</code>The decorator defined this way can accept parameters:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; @repeat(2)\n... def foo():\n...     print(\"foo\")\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()\nfoo\nfoo\n</code>Note that even if the parametrized decorator has default values for its arguments, the parentheses after its name is required. The correct way to use the preceding decorator with default arguments is as follows:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; @repeat()\n... def bar():\n...     print(\"bar\")\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()\nbar\nbar\nbar\n</code>Finally lets see decorators with Properties.PropertiesThe properties provide a built-in descriptor type that knows how to link an attribute to a set of methods. A property takes four optional arguments: fget , fset , fdel , and doc . The last one can be provided to define a docstring that is linked to the attribute as if it were a method. Here is an example of a Rectangle class that can be controlled either by direct access to attributes that store two corner points or by using the width , and height properties:<code>class Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        self.x1, self.y1 = x1, y1\n        self.x2, self.y2 = x2, y2    def _width_get(self):\n        return self.x2 - self.x1    def _width_set(self, value):\n        self.x2 = self.x1 + value    def _height_get(self):\n        return self.y2 - self.y1    def _height_set(self, value):\n        self.y2 = self.y1 + value    width = property(\n        _width_get, _width_set,\n        doc=\"rectangle width measured from left\"\n    )\n    height = property(\n        _height_get, _height_set,\n        doc=\"rectangle height measured from top\"\n    )    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"{}({}, {}, {}, {})\".format(\n            self.__class__.__name__,\n            self.x1, self.y1, self.x2, self.y2\n    )\n</code>The best syntax for creating properties is using property as a decorator. This will reduce the number of method signatures inside of the class\nand make code more readable and maintainable. With decorators the above class becomes:<code>class Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):\n        self.x1, self.y1 = x1, y1\n        self.x2, self.y2 = x2, y2    @property\n    def width(self):\n        \"\"\"rectangle height measured from top\"\"\"\n        return self.x2 - self.x1    @width.setter\n    def width(self, value):\n        self.x2 = self.x1 + value    @property\n    def height(self):\n        \"\"\"rectangle height measured from top\"\"\"\n        return self.y2 - self.y1    @height.setter\n    def height(self, value):\n        self.y2 = self.y1 + value\n</code>"], "score": ["549", "15"], "acce_score": ["905", "905"], "reward": [[-6.514922618865967, 0.1463414579629898, -0.11516156047582626], [0.14916206896305084, -0.4615384638309479, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

Could someone explain what the difference is between a OneToOne, ManyToMany and ForeignKey?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["Well, there's essentially two questions here:\nWhat is the difference (in general) between one to one, many to many, and foreign key relations\nWhat are their differences specific to Django. \nBoth of these questions are quite easily answered through a simple Google search, but as I cannot find an exact dupe of this question on SO, I'll go ahead and answer.Note that in Django, relationships should only be defined on one side of the relationship.ForeignKeyA foreign key relationship is generally known as a many-to-one relationship. Note that the reverse of this relationship is one-to-many (which Django provides tools to access). As the name implies, many objects may be related to one.<code>Person &gt;--| Birthplace\n   ^           ^\n   |           |\n  Many        One \n</code>In this example, a person may only have one birthplace, but a birthplace may be related to many people. Let's look at this example in Django. Say these are our models:<code>class Birthplace(models.Model):\n    city = models.CharField(max_length=75)\n    state = models.CharField(max_length=25)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.city, \", \", self.state)class Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    birthplace = models.ForeignKey(Birthplace)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.name\n</code>You can see that no relations are defined within the <code>Birthplace</code> model, and a <code>ForeignKey</code> relationship is defined within the <code>Person</code> model. Say that we create the following instances of our models (obviously not in Python syntax):\nBirthplace: Dallas, Texas\nBirthplace: New York City, New York\nPerson: John Smith, Birthplace : (Dallas, Texas)\nPerson: Maria Lee, Birthplace : (Dallas, Texas)\nPerson: Daniel Lee, Birthplace : (New York City, New York)\nNow we can see how Django lets us use these relations (note that <code>./manage.py shell</code> is your friend!):<code>&gt;&gt; from somewhere.models import Birthplace, Person\n&gt;&gt; Person.objects.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;, &lt;Person: Daniel Lee&gt;]\n&gt;&gt; Birthplace.objects.all()\n[&lt;Birthplace: Dallas, Texas&gt;, &lt;Birthplace: New York City, New York&gt;]\n</code>You can see the model instances we created. Now let's checkout someone's birthplace:<code>&gt;&gt; person = Person.object.get(name=\"John Smith\")\n&gt;&gt; person.birthplace\n&lt;Birthplace: Dallas, Texas&gt;\n&gt;&gt; person.birthplace.city\nDallas\n</code>Let's say you want to see all people with a given birthplace. As I said earlier, Django allows you to access reverse relations. By default, Django creates a manager (<code>RelatedManager</code>) on your model to handle this, named <code>&lt;model&gt;_set</code>, where <code>&lt;model&gt;</code> is your model name in lowercase.<code>&gt;&gt; place = Birthplace.objects.get(city=\"Dallas\")\n&gt;&gt; place.person_set.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;]\n</code>Note that we can change the name of this manager by setting the <code>related_name</code> keyword argument in our model relation. So, we would change the <code>birthplace</code> field in the <code>Person</code> model to:<code>birthplace = models.ForeignKey(Birthplace, related_name=\"people\")\n</code>Now, we can access that reverse relationship with a pretty name:<code>&gt;&gt; place.people.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;]\n</code>One-to-oneA one-to-one relationship is quite similar to a many-to-one relationship, except that it restricts two objects to having a unique relationship. An example of this would be a User and a Profile (which stores information about the user). No two users share the same profile. <code>User |--| Profile\n  ^          ^\n  |          |\n One        One\n</code>Let's look at this in Django. I won't bother to define the user model, as Django defines it for us. Do note, however, that Django suggests using <code>django.contrib.auth.get_user_model()</code> to import the user, so that's what we'll do. The profile model may be defined as follows:<code>class Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL) # Note that Django suggests getting the User from the settings for relationship definitions\n    fruit = models.CharField(max_length=50, help_text=\"Favorite Fruit\")\n    facebook = models.CharField(max_length=100, help_text=\"Facebook Username\")    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.fruit, \" \", self.facebook)\n</code>All we need is one user with a profile to test this out in the shell:\nUser: johndt6\nProfile: user : johndt6, \"Kiwi\", \"blah_blah\"\nNow you may easily access the user's profile from the User model:<code>&gt;&gt; user = User.objects.all()[0]\n&gt;&gt; user.username\njohndt6\n&gt;&gt; user.profile\n&lt;Profile: Kiwi blah_blah&gt;\n&gt;&gt; user.profile.fruit\nKiwi\n&gt;&gt; profile = Profile.objects.get(user=user)\n&gt;&gt; profile.user\n&lt;User: johndt6&gt;\n</code>Of course, you may customize the name of the reverse relation using the <code>related_name</code> argument as above.Many-to-manyMany-to-many relationships can be a bit tricky. Let me start by saying that many-to-many fields are messy, and should be avoided when possible. Given that, there are plenty of situations where a many-to-many relationship makes sense.A many-to-many relationship between two models defines that zero, one or more objects of the first model may be related to zero, one or more objects of the second model. As an example, let's envision a company that defines their workflow through projects. A project may be related to no orders, only one order, or many orders. An order may be related to no projects, one project, or many. <code>Order &gt;--&lt; Project\n  ^           ^\n  |           |\n Many        Many\n</code>Let's define our models as so:<code>class Order(models.Model):\n    product = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # Note that in reality, this would probably be better served by a Product model\n    customer = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # The same may be said for customers    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.product, \" for \", self.customer)class Project(models.Model):\n    orders = models.ManyToManyField(Order)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(\"Project \", str(self.id))\n</code>Note that Django will create a <code>RelatedManager</code> for the <code>orders</code> field to access the many-to-many relationship.Let's create the following instances of our models (in my inconsistent syntax!):\nOrder: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\"\nOrder: \"Submarine\", \"US Navy\"\nOrder: \"Race car\", \"NASCAR\"\nProject: orders: []\nProject: orders: [(Order: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\")]\nProject: orders: [(Order: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\"), (Order: \"Race car\", \"NASCAR\")]\nWe can access these relationships as follows:<code>&gt;&gt; Project.objects.all()\n[&lt;Project: Project 0&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 1&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 2&gt;]\n&gt;&gt; for proj in Project.objects.all():\n..     print(proj)\n..     proj.orders.all()  # Note that we must access the `orders`\n..                        # field through its manager\n..     print(\"\")\nProject 0\n[]Project 1\n[&lt;Order: Spaceship for NASA&gt;]Project 2\n[&lt;Order: Spaceship for NASA&gt;, &lt;Order: Race car for NASCAR&gt;]\n</code>Note that the NASA order is related to 2 projects, and the US Navy order is related to none. Also note that one project has no orders, and one has multiple.We may also access the relationship in reverse in the same way we have before:<code>&gt;&gt; order = Order.objects.filter(customer=\"NASA\")[0]\n&gt;&gt; order.project_set.all()\n[&lt;Project: Project 0&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 2&gt;]\n</code>ASCII Cardinality GuideIn the likely case that my ASCII diagrams are a bit confusing, the following explanations might be helpful:\n<code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> means \"to many\"\n<code>|</code> means \"to one\"\nSo... <code>A --| B</code> means an instance of A can be related to only ONE instance of B.And <code>A --&lt; B</code> means an instance of A can be related to MANY instances of B.<code>A &gt;--&lt; B</code> is equivalent to....<code>A --&lt; B\nA &gt;-- B\n</code>Thus, each \"side\" or direction of the relationship can be read separately. It's just convenient to squish them together.Expanding one of these relationships might make more sense:<code>               +---- John Smith\n               |\n Dallas|-------+---- Jane Doe\n               |\n               +---- Joe Smoe\n</code>ResourcesGood explanation of db relationships provided by @MarcBWikipedia page on CardinalityDjango Docs:<code>models.ForeignKey</code><code>models.OneToOneField</code><code>models.ManyToManyField</code>One-to-one RelationshipsMany-to-many Relationships", "In my point of View the diff b/w One-To-One &amp; One-To-Many is\nOne-To-One : it means one person can contain one passport only\nOne-To-Many : it means one person can contain many address like(permanent address, Office address, Secondary Address)\nif you call the parent model it will automatically call the many child class"], "score": ["278", "0"], "acce_score": ["101", "101"], "reward": [[-0.03938829526305199, -0.757709264755249, 0.8599106073379517], [-6.698796272277832, -1.0, 0.03129657357931137]], "sft_index": 0}

For example:If you want to store music, you must first encode it using MP3, WAV, etc.\nIf you want to store a picture, you must first encode it using PNG, JPEG, etc.\nIf you want to store text, you must first encode it using ASCII, UTF-8, etc.MP3, WAV, PNG, JPEG, ASCII and UTF-8 are examples of encodings. An encoding is a format to represent audio, images, text, etc. in bytes.\nIn Python, a byte string is just that: a sequence of bytes. It isn't human-readable. Under the hood, everything must be converted to a byte string before it can be stored in a computer.\nOn the other hand, a character string, often just called a &quot;string&quot;, is a sequence of characters. It is human-readable. A character string can't be directly stored in a computer, it has to be encoded first (converted into a byte string). There are multiple encodings through which a character string can be converted into a byte string, such as ASCII and UTF-8.\n<code>'I am a string'.encode('ASCII')\n</code>\nThe above Python code will encode the string 'I am a string' using the encoding ASCII. The result of the above code will be a byte string. If you print it, Python will represent it as <code>b'I am a string'</code>. Remember, however, that byte strings aren't human-readable, it's just that Python decodes them from ASCII when you print them. In Python, a byte string is represented by a <code>b</code>, followed by the byte string's ASCII representation.\nA byte string can be decoded back into a character string, if you know the encoding that was used to encode it.\n<code>b'I am a string'.decode('ASCII')\n</code>\nThe above code will return the original string <code>'I am a string'</code>.\nEncoding and decoding are inverse operations. Everything must be encoded before it can be written to disk, and it must be decoded before it can be read by a human.", "From What is Unicode?:Fundamentally, computers just deal with numbers. They store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one.\n......\nUnicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter what the platform, no matter what the program, no matter what the language.So when a computer represents a string, it finds characters stored in the computer of the string through their unique Unicode number and these figures are stored in memory. But you can't directly write the string to disk or transmit the string on network through their unique Unicode number because these figures are just simple decimal number. You should encode the string to byte string, such as UTF-8. UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters and it stores characters as bytes (it looks like this). So the encoded string can be used everywhere because UTF-8 is nearly supported everywhere. When you open a text file encoded in UTF-8 from other systems, your computer will decode it and display characters in it through their unique Unicode number.\nWhen a browser receive string data encoded UTF-8 from the network, it will decode the data to string (assume the browser in UTF-8 encoding) and display the string.\nIn Python 3, you can transform string and byte string to each other:\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('中文'.encode('utf-8'))\nb'\\xe4\\xb8\\xad\\xe6\\x96\\x87'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(b'\\xe4\\xb8\\xad\\xe6\\x96\\x87'.decode('utf-8'))\n中文\n</code>\nIn a word, string is for displaying to humans to read on a computer and byte string is for storing to disk and data transmission."], "score": ["715", "6"], "acce_score": ["365", "365"], "reward": [[2.7733240127563477, 1.0, 1.0], [-1.332688331604004, -1.0, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

But how about following examples?<code>def test(a : dict = None):    #print(a) ==&gt; {'a': 1234}    #or    #print(a) ==&gt; Nonedef test(a : list = None):    #print(a) ==&gt; [1,2,3,4, 'a', 'b']    #or    #print(a) ==&gt; None</code>If <code>Optional[type]</code> seems to mean the same thing as <code>Union[type, None]</code>, why should I use <code>Optional[]</code> at all?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["<code>Optional[...]</code> is a shorthand notation for <code>Union[..., None]</code>, telling the type checker that either an object of the specific type is required, or <code>None</code> is required. <code>...</code> stands for any valid type hint, including complex compound types or a <code>Union[]</code> of more types. Whenever you have a keyword argument with default value <code>None</code>, you should use <code>Optional</code>. (Note: If you are targeting Python 3.10 or newer, PEP 604 introduced a better syntax, see below).\nSo for your two examples, you have <code>dict</code> and <code>list</code> container types, but the default value for the <code>a</code> keyword argument shows that <code>None</code> is permitted too so use <code>Optional[...]</code>:\n<code>from typing import Optionaldef test(a: Optional[dict] = None) -&gt; None:\n    #print(a) ==&gt; {'a': 1234}\n    #or\n    #print(a) ==&gt; Nonedef test(a: Optional[list] = None) -&gt; None:\n    #print(a) ==&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'b']\n    #or\n    #print(a) ==&gt; None\n</code>\nThere is technically no difference between using <code>Optional[]</code> on a <code>Union[]</code>, or just adding <code>None</code> to the <code>Union[]</code>. So <code>Optional[Union[str, int]]</code> and <code>Union[str, int, None]</code> are exactly the same thing.\nPersonally, I'd stick with always using <code>Optional[]</code> when setting the type for a keyword argument that uses <code>= None</code> to set a default value, this documents the reason why <code>None</code> is allowed better. Moreover, it makes it easier to move the <code>Union[...]</code> part into a separate type alias, or to later remove the <code>Optional[...]</code> part if an argument becomes mandatory.\nFor example, say you have\n<code>from typing import Optional, Uniondef api_function(optional_argument: Optional[Union[str, int]] = None) -&gt; None:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Frob the fooznar.    If optional_argument is given, it must be an id of the fooznar subwidget\n    to filter on. The id should be a string, or for backwards compatibility,\n    an integer is also accepted.    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n</code>\nthen documentation is improved by pulling out the <code>Union[str, int]</code> into a type alias:\n<code>from typing import Optional, Union# subwidget ids used to be integers, now they are strings. Support both.\nSubWidgetId = Union[str, int]\ndef api_function(optional_argument: Optional[SubWidgetId] = None) -&gt; None:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Frob the fooznar.    If optional_argument is given, it must be an id of the fooznar subwidget\n    to filter on. The id should be a string, or for backwards compatibility,\n    an integer is also accepted.    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n</code>\nThe refactor to move the <code>Union[]</code> into an alias was made all the much easier because <code>Optional[...]</code> was used instead of <code>Union[str, int, None]</code>. The <code>None</code> value is not a 'subwidget id' after all, it's not part of the value, <code>None</code> is meant to flag the absence of a value.\nSide note: Unless your code only has to support Python 3.9 or newer, you want to avoid using the standard library container types in type hinting, as you can't say anything about what types they must contain. So instead of <code>dict</code> and <code>list</code>, use <code>typing.Dict</code> and <code>typing.List</code>, respectively. And when only reading from a container type, you may just as well accept any immutable abstract container type; lists and tuples are <code>Sequence</code> objects, while <code>dict</code> is a <code>Mapping</code> type:\n<code>from typing import Mapping, Optional, Sequence, Uniondef test(a: Optional[Mapping[str, int]] = None) -&gt; None:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;accepts an optional map with string keys and integer values&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    # print(a) ==&gt; {'a': 1234}\n    # or\n    # print(a) ==&gt; Nonedef test(a: Optional[Sequence[Union[int, str]]] = None) -&gt; None:\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;accepts an optional sequence of integers and strings\n    # print(a) ==&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'b']\n    # or\n    # print(a) ==&gt; None\n</code>\nIn Python 3.9 and up, the standard container types have all been updated to support using them in type hints, see PEP 585. But, while you now can use <code>dict[str, int]</code> or <code>list[Union[int, str]]</code>, you still may want to use the more expressive <code>Mapping</code> and <code>Sequence</code> annotations to indicate that a function won't be mutating the contents (they are treated as 'read only'), and that the functions would work with any object that works as a mapping or sequence, respectively.\nPython 3.10 introduces the <code>|</code> union operator into type hinting, see PEP  604. Instead of <code>Union[str, int]</code> you can write <code>str | int</code>. In line with other type-hinted languages, the preferred (and more concise) way to denote an optional argument in Python 3.10 and up, is now <code>Type | None</code>, e.g. <code>str | None</code> or <code>list | None</code>.", "While the accepted answer is the correct answer, one additional thing to note is that, in the context of <code>kwargs</code>, both <code>Optional[...]</code> and <code>Union[..., None]</code> are redundant and unnecessary.  If you're immediately setting your kwarg to <code>None</code>, then both <code>mypy</code> and IDEs assume the obvious and automatically treat the arg as <code>Optional[...]</code>.\nIDE:mypy:For variables and method/function return values, <code>Optional[...]</code> is still necessary, however, as <code>mypy</code> cannot know, in those cases, to automatically assume anything."], "score": ["516", "13"], "acce_score": ["342", "342"], "reward": [[4.717327117919922, 1.0, 1.0], [-0.2075866460800171, -1.0, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

However, there is a small set of cases (usually involving a recurrence) which cannot be vectorized in obvious ways. Furthermore, on a smallish <code>DataFrame</code>, it may be faster to use other methods.<code>apply</code> usually can be handled by an iterator in Cython space. This is handled internally by pandas, though it depends on what is going on inside the <code>apply</code> expression. For example, <code>df.apply(lambda x: np.sum(x))</code> will be executed pretty swiftly, though of course, <code>df.sum(1)</code> is even better. However something like <code>df.apply(lambda x: x['b'] + 1)</code> will be executed in Python space, and consequently is much slower.<code>itertuples</code> does not box the data into a <code>Series</code>. It just returns the data in the form of tuples.<code>iterrows</code> does box the data into a <code>Series</code>. Unless you really need this, use another method.Updating an empty frame a-single-row-at-a-time. I have seen this method used WAY too much. It is by far the slowest. It is probably common place (and reasonably fast for some Python structures), but a <code>DataFrame</code> does a fair number of checks on indexing, so this will always be very slow to update a row at a time.

As Kabie points out, you can solve this problem using sets...<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; set(['a', 'b']).issubset(set(['a', 'b', 'foo', 'bar']))\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; {'a', 'b'} &lt;= {'a', 'b', 'foo', 'bar'}\nTrue\n</code>...sometimes:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {'a', ['b']} &lt;= {'a', ['b'], 'foo', 'bar'}\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n</code>Sets can only be created with hashable elements. But the generator expression <code>all(x in container for x in items)</code> can handle almost any container type. The only requirement is that <code>container</code> be re-iterable (i.e. not a generator). <code>items</code> can be any iterable at all.<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; container = [['b'], 'a', 'foo', 'bar']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; items = (i for i in ('a', ['b']))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; all(x in [['b'], 'a', 'foo', 'bar'] for x in items)\nTrue\n</code>Speed TestsIn many cases, the subset test will be faster than <code>all</code>, but the difference isn't shocking -- except when the question is irrelevant because sets aren't an option. Converting lists to sets just for the purpose of a test like this won't always be worth the trouble. And converting generators to sets can sometimes be incredibly wasteful, slowing programs down by many orders of magnitude.Here are a few benchmarks for illustration. The biggest difference comes when both <code>container</code> and <code>items</code> are relatively small. In that case, the subset approach is about an order of magnitude faster:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; smallset = set(range(10))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; smallsubset = set(range(5))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit smallset &gt;= smallsubset\n110 ns ± 0.702 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit all(x in smallset for x in smallsubset)\n951 ns ± 11.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)\n</code>This looks like a big difference. But as long as <code>container</code> is a set, <code>all</code> is still perfectly usable at vastly larger scales:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bigset = set(range(100000))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bigsubset = set(range(50000))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit bigset &gt;= bigsubset\n1.14 ms ± 13.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit all(x in bigset for x in bigsubset)\n5.96 ms ± 37 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n</code>Using subset testing is still faster, but only by about 5x at this scale. The speed boost is due to Python's fast <code>c</code>-backed implementation of <code>set</code>, but the fundamental algorithm is the same in both cases.If your <code>items</code> are already stored in a list for other reasons, then you'll have to convert them to a set before using the subset test approach. Then the speedup drops to about 2.5x:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit bigset &gt;= set(bigsubseq)\n2.1 ms ± 49.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n</code>And if your <code>container</code> is a sequence, and needs to be converted first, then the speedup is even smaller:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit set(bigseq) &gt;= set(bigsubseq)\n4.36 ms ± 31.4 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n</code>The only time we get disastrously slow results is when we leave <code>container</code> as a sequence:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit all(x in bigseq for x in bigsubseq)\n184 ms ± 994 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\n</code>And of course, we'll only do that if we must. If all the items in <code>bigseq</code> are hashable, then we'll do this instead:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit bigset = set(bigseq); all(x in bigset for x in bigsubseq)\n7.24 ms ± 78 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n</code>That's just 1.66x faster than the alternative (<code>set(bigseq) &gt;= set(bigsubseq)</code>, timed above at 4.36).So subset testing is generally faster, but not by an incredible margin. On the other hand, let's look at when <code>all</code> is faster. What if <code>items</code> is ten-million values long, and is likely to have values that aren't in <code>container</code>?<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hugeiter = (x * 10 for bss in [bigsubseq] * 2000 for x in bss); set(bigset) &gt;= set(hugeiter)\n13.1 s ± 167 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit hugeiter = (x * 10 for bss in [bigsubseq] * 2000 for x in bss); all(x in bigset for x in hugeiter)\n2.33 ms ± 65.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\n</code>Converting the generator into a set turns out to be incredibly wasteful in this case. The <code>set</code> constructor has to consume the entire generator. But the short-circuiting behavior of <code>all</code> ensures that only a small portion of the generator needs to be consumed, so it's faster than a subset test by four orders of magnitude. This is an extreme example, admittedly. But as it shows, you can't assume that one approach or the other will be faster in all cases.The UpshotMost of the time, converting <code>container</code> to a set is worth it, at least if all its elements are hashable. That's because <code>in</code> for sets is O(1), while <code>in</code> for sequences is O(n). On the other hand, using subset testing is probably only worth it sometimes. Definitely do it if your test items are already stored in a set. Otherwise, <code>all</code> is only a little slower, and doesn't require any additional storage. It can also be used with large generators of items, and sometimes provides a massive speedup in that case.", "I would say we can even leave those square brackets out. <code>array = ['b', 'a', 'foo', 'bar']\nall([i in array for i in 'a', 'b'])\n</code>"], "score": ["292", "2"], "acce_score": ["177", "177"], "reward": [[3.011833429336548, 1.0, 1.0], [0.6402896046638489, -1.0, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

This allows for the specification of types contained within collections. As of November 2015, JetBrains PyCharm 5.0 fully supports Python 3.5 to include Type Hints as illustrated below.Original Answer\nAs of Aug 2014, I have confirmed that it is not possible to use Python 3 type annotations to specify types within collections (ex: a list of strings).\nThe use of formatted docstrings such as reStructuredText or Sphinx are viable alternatives and supported by various IDEs.\nIt also appears that Guido is mulling over the idea of extending type annotations in the spirit of mypy: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2014-August/028618.html", "As of Python 3.9, builtin types are generic with respect to type annotations (see PEP 585). This allows to directly specify the type of elements:\n<code>def my_func(l: list[int]):\n    pass\n</code>\nThis also extends to most other container types of the standard library, for example <code>collections.deque</code> or <code>collections.abc.Mapping</code>.Various tools may support this syntax earlier than Python 3.9. When annotations are not inspected at runtime, the syntax is valid using quoting or <code>__future__.annotations</code>.\n<code># quoted\ndef my_func(l: 'list[int]'):\n    pass\n</code>\n<code># postponed evaluation of annotation\nfrom __future__ import annotationsdef my_func(l: list[int]):\n    pass\n</code>As a consequence of PEP 585, most helpers in <code>typing</code> corresponding to standard library types are deprecated, such as <code>typing.List</code>, <code>typing.Deque</code> or <code>typing.Mapping</code>.

If you select by column first, a view can be returned (which is\nquicker than returning a copy) and the original dtype is preserved. In contrast,\nif you select by row first, and if the DataFrame has columns of different\ndtypes, then Pandas copies the data into a new Series of object dtype. So\nselecting columns is a bit faster than selecting rows. Thus, although\n<code>df_test.iloc[0]['Btime']</code> works, <code>df_test['Btime'].iloc[0]</code> is a little bit\nmore efficient.There is a big difference between the two when it comes to assignment.\n<code>df_test['Btime'].iloc[0] = x</code> affects <code>df_test</code>, but <code>df_test.iloc[0]['Btime']</code>\nmay not. See below for an explanation of why.  Because a subtle difference in\nthe order of indexing makes a big difference in behavior, it is better to use single indexing assignment:<code>df.iloc[0, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x\n</code><code>df.iloc[0, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x</code> (recommended):The recommended way to assign new values to a\nDataFrame is to avoid chained indexing, and instead use the method shown by\nandrew,<code>df.loc[df.index[n], 'Btime'] = x\n</code>or <code>df.iloc[n, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x\n</code>The latter method is a bit faster, because <code>df.loc</code> has to convert the row and column labels to\npositional indices, so there is a little less conversion necessary if you use\n<code>df.iloc</code> instead.<code>df['Btime'].iloc[0] = x</code> works, but is not recommended:Although this works, it is taking advantage of the way DataFrames are currently implemented. There is no guarantee that Pandas has to work this way in the future. In particular, it is taking advantage of the fact that (currently) <code>df['Btime']</code> always returns a\nview (not a copy) so <code>df['Btime'].iloc[n] = x</code> can be used to assign a new value\nat the nth location of the <code>Btime</code> column of <code>df</code>.Since Pandas makes no explicit guarantees about when indexers return a view versus a copy, assignments that use chained indexing generally always raise a <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code> even though in this case the assignment succeeds in modifying <code>df</code>:<code>In [22]: df = pd.DataFrame({'foo':list('ABC')}, index=[0,2,1])\nIn [24]: df['bar'] = 100\nIn [25]: df['bar'].iloc[0] = 99\n/home/unutbu/data/binky/bin/ipython:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrameSee the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy\n  self._setitem_with_indexer(indexer, value)In [26]: df\nOut[26]: \n  foo  bar\n0   A   99  &lt;-- assignment succeeded\n2   B  100\n1   C  100\n</code><code>df.iloc[0]['Btime'] = x</code> does not work:In contrast, assignment with <code>df.iloc[0]['bar'] = 123</code> does not work because <code>df.iloc[0]</code> is returning a copy:<code>In [66]: df.iloc[0]['bar'] = 123\n/home/unutbu/data/binky/bin/ipython:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrameSee the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copyIn [67]: df\nOut[67]: \n  foo  bar\n0   A   99  &lt;-- assignment failed\n2   B  100\n1   C  100\n</code>Warning: I had previously suggested <code>df_test.ix[i, 'Btime']</code>. But this is not guaranteed to give you the <code>ith</code> value since <code>ix</code> tries to index by label before trying to index by position. So if the DataFrame has an integer index which is not in sorted order starting at 0, then using <code>ix[i]</code> will return the row labeled <code>i</code> rather than the <code>ith</code> row. For example,<code>In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({'foo':list('ABC')}, index=[0,2,1])In [2]: df\nOut[2]: \n  foo\n0   A\n2   B\n1   CIn [4]: df.ix[1, 'foo']\nOut[4]: 'C'\n</code>", "To access a single value you can use the method <code>iat</code> that is much faster than <code>iloc</code>:\n<code>df['Btime'].iat[0]\n</code>\nYou can also use the method <code>take</code>:\n<code>df['Btime'].take(0)\n</code>"], "score": ["800", "12"], "acce_score": ["506", "506"], "reward": [[-0.7244345545768738, 1.0, 0.933742344379425], [2.3852527141571045, 0.29411765933036804, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

Therefore, standard attribute access is the normal, Pythonic way of, well, accessing attributes.The advantage of properties is that they are syntactically identical to attribute access, so you can change from one to another without any changes to client code. You could even have one version of a class that uses properties (say, for code-by-contract or debugging) and one that doesn't for production, without changing the code that uses it.

You can also add a cause to an exception, making the traceback explicit about the other exception (use different wording), and the context is ignored (but can still be introspected when debugging). Using <code>raise ... from None</code> lets you suppress the context being printed.\nSee the <code>raise</code> statement documenation:The <code>from</code> clause is used for exception chaining: if given, the second expression must be another exception class or instance, which will then be attached to the raised exception as the <code>__cause__</code> attribute (which is writable).

In today’s Python (version 2.4), if this happens, exception B is propagated outward and exception A is lost. In order to debug the problem, it is useful to know about both exceptions. The <code>__context__</code> attribute retains this information automatically.\nSometimes it can be useful for an exception handler to intentionally re-raise an exception, either to provide extra information or to translate an exception to another type. The <code>__cause__</code> attribute provides an explicit way to record the direct cause of an exception.\n[…]\nImplicit Exception Chaining\nHere is an example to illustrate the <code>__context__</code> attribute:\n<code>def compute(a, b):\n    try:\n        a/b\n    except Exception, exc:\n        log(exc)def log(exc):\n    file = open('logfile.txt')  # oops, forgot the 'w'\n    print &gt;&gt;file, exc\n    file.close()\n</code>\nCalling <code>compute(0, 0)</code> causes a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>. The <code>compute()</code> function catches this exception and calls <code>log(exc)</code>, but the <code>log()</code> function also raises an exception when it tries to write to a file that wasn’t opened for writing.\nIn today’s Python, the caller of <code>compute()</code> gets thrown an <code>IOError</code>. The <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> is lost. With the proposed change, the instance of <code>IOError</code> has an additional <code>__context__</code> attribute that retains the <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.\n[…]\nExplicit Exception Chaining\nThe <code>__cause__</code> attribute on exception objects is always initialized to <code>None</code>. It is set by a new form of the <code>raise</code> statement:\n<code>raise EXCEPTION from CAUSE\n</code>\nwhich is equivalent to:\n<code>exc = EXCEPTION\nexc.__cause__ = CAUSE\nraise exc\n</code>\nIn the following example, a database provides implementations for a few different kinds of storage, with file storage as one kind. The database designer wants errors to propagate as <code>DatabaseError</code> objects so that the client doesn’t have to be aware of the storage-specific details, but doesn’t want to lose the underlying error information.\n<code>class DatabaseError(Exception):\n    passclass FileDatabase(Database):\n    def __init__(self, filename):\n        try:\n            self.file = open(filename)\n        except IOError, exc:\n            raise DatabaseError('failed to open') from exc\n</code>\nIf the call to <code>open()</code> raises an exception, the problem will be reported as a <code>DatabaseError</code>, with a <code>__cause__</code> attribute that reveals the <code>IOError</code> as the original cause.\nEnhanced Reporting\nThe default exception handler will be modified to report chained exceptions. The chain of exceptions is traversed by following the <code>__cause__</code> and <code>__context__</code> attributes, with <code>__cause__</code> taking priority. In keeping with the chronological order of tracebacks, the most recently raised exception is displayed last; that is, the display begins with the description of the innermost exception and backs up the chain to the outermost exception. The tracebacks are formatted as usual, with one of the lines:The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:orDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:between tracebacks, depending whether they are linked by <code>__cause__</code> or <code>__context__</code> respectively. Here is a sketch of the procedure:\n<code>def print_chain(exc):\n    if exc.__cause__:\n        print_chain(exc.__cause__)\n        print '\\nThe above exception was the direct cause...'\n    elif exc.__context__:\n        print_chain(exc.__context__)\n        print '\\nDuring handling of the above exception, ...'\n    print_exc(exc)\n</code>\n[…]In 2012, PEP 415, Implement Context Suppression with Exception Attributes introduced exception context suppression with explicit <code>raise EXCEPTION from None</code> (<code>__suppress_context__</code> attribute).Proposal\nA new attribute on <code>BaseException</code>, <code>__suppress_context__</code>, will be introduced.

In Python 3 you need to add parentheses around the value to be printed:<code>print(\"Hello, World!\")\n</code>“SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'” is a new error message that was added in Python 3.4.2 primarily to help users that are trying to follow a Python 2 tutorial while running Python 3.In Python 3, printing values changed from being a distinct statement to being an ordinary function call, so it now needs parentheses:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n</code>In earlier versions of Python 3, the interpreter just reports a generic syntax error, without providing any useful hints as to what might be going wrong:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print \"Hello, World!\"\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1\n    print \"Hello, World!\"\n                        ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n</code>As for why <code>print</code> became an ordinary function in Python 3, that didn't relate to the basic form of the statement, but rather to how you did more complicated things like printing multiple items to stderr with a trailing space rather than ending the line.In Python 2:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, 1, 2, 3,; print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, 4, 5, 6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n</code>In Python 3:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(1, 2, 3, file=sys.stderr, end=\" \"); print(4, 5, 6, file=sys.stderr)\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n</code>Starting with the Python 3.6.3 release in September 2017, some error messages related to the Python 2.x print syntax have been updated to recommend their Python 3.x counterparts:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print \"Hello!\"\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1\n    print \"Hello!\"\n                 ^\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(\"Hello!\")?\n</code>Since the \"Missing parentheses in call to print\" case is a compile time syntax error and hence has access to the raw source code, it's able to include the full text on the rest of the line in the suggested replacement. However, it doesn't currently try to work out the appropriate quotes to place around that expression (that's not impossible, just sufficiently complicated that it hasn't been done).The <code>TypeError</code> raised for the right shift operator has also been customised:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &gt;&gt;: 'builtin_function_or_method' and '_io.TextIOWrapper'. Did you mean \"print(&lt;message&gt;, file=&lt;output_stream&gt;)\"?\n</code>Since this error is raised when the code runs, rather than when it is compiled, it doesn't have access to the raw source code, and hence uses meta-variables (<code>&lt;message&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;output_stream&gt;</code>) in the suggested replacement expression instead of whatever the user actually typed.

Now let's suppose we want to...multiply <code>A</code> with <code>B</code> in a particular way to create new array of products; and then maybe\nsum this new array along particular axes; and then maybe\ntranspose the axes of the new array in a particular order.There's a good chance that <code>einsum</code> will help us do this faster and more memory-efficiently than combinations of the NumPy functions like <code>multiply</code>, <code>sum</code> and <code>transpose</code> will allow.\nHow does <code>einsum</code> work?\nHere's a simple (but not completely trivial) example. Take the following two arrays:\n<code>A = np.array([0, 1, 2])B = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\n              [ 4,  5,  6,  7],\n              [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])\n</code>\nWe will multiply <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> element-wise and then sum along the rows of the new array. In &quot;normal&quot; NumPy we'd write:\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (A[:, np.newaxis] * B).sum(axis=1)\narray([ 0, 22, 76])\n</code>\nSo here, the indexing operation on <code>A</code> lines up the first axes of the two arrays so that the multiplication can be broadcast. The rows of the array of products are then summed to return the answer.\nNow if we wanted to use <code>einsum</code> instead, we could write:\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; np.einsum('i,ij-&gt;i', A, B)\narray([ 0, 22, 76])\n</code>\nThe signature string <code>'i,ij-&gt;i'</code> is the key here and needs a little bit of explaining. You can think of it in two halves. On the left-hand side (left of the <code>-&gt;</code>) we've labelled the two input arrays. To the right of <code>-&gt;</code>, we've labelled the array we want to end up with.\nHere is what happens next:<code>A</code> has one axis; we've labelled it <code>i</code>. And <code>B</code> has two axes; we've labelled axis 0 as <code>i</code> and axis 1 as <code>j</code>.By repeating the label <code>i</code> in both input arrays, we are telling <code>einsum</code> that these two axes should be multiplied together. In other words, we're multiplying array <code>A</code> with each column of array <code>B</code>, just like <code>A[:, np.newaxis] * B</code> does.Notice that <code>j</code> does not appear as a label in our desired output; we've just used <code>i</code> (we want to end up with a 1D array). By omitting the label, we're telling <code>einsum</code> to sum along this axis. In other words, we're summing the rows of the products, just like <code>.sum(axis=1)</code> does.\nThat's basically all you need to know to use <code>einsum</code>. It helps to play about a little; if we leave both labels in the output, <code>'i,ij-&gt;ij'</code>, we get back a 2D array of products (same as <code>A[:, np.newaxis] * B</code>). If we say no output labels, <code>'i,ij-&gt;</code>, we get back a single number (same as doing <code>(A[:, np.newaxis] * B).sum()</code>).\nThe great thing about <code>einsum</code> however, is that it does not build a temporary array of products first; it just sums the products as it goes. This can lead to big savings in memory use.\nA slightly bigger example\nTo explain the dot product, here are two new arrays:\n<code>A = array([[1, 1, 1],\n           [2, 2, 2],\n           [5, 5, 5]])B = array([[0, 1, 0],\n           [1, 1, 0],\n           [1, 1, 1]])\n</code>\nWe will compute the dot product using <code>np.einsum('ij,jk-&gt;ik', A, B)</code>. Here's a picture showing the labelling of the <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and the output array that we get from the function:You can see that label <code>j</code> is repeated - this means we're multiplying the rows of <code>A</code> with the columns of <code>B</code>. Furthermore, the label <code>j</code> is not included in the output - we're summing these products. Labels <code>i</code> and <code>k</code> are kept for the output, so we get back a 2D array.\nIt might be even clearer to compare this result with the array where the label <code>j</code> is not summed. Below, on the left you can see the 3D array that results from writing <code>np.einsum('ij,jk-&gt;ijk', A, B)</code> (i.e. we've kept label <code>j</code>):Summing axis <code>j</code> gives the expected dot product, shown on the right.\nSome exercises\nTo get more of a feel for <code>einsum</code>, it can be useful to implement familiar NumPy array operations using the subscript notation. Anything that involves combinations of multiplying and summing axes can be written using  <code>einsum</code>.\nLet A and B be two 1D arrays with the same length. For example, <code>A = np.arange(10)</code> and <code>B = np.arange(5, 15)</code>.The sum of <code>A</code> can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('i-&gt;', A)\n</code>Element-wise multiplication, <code>A * B</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('i,i-&gt;i', A, B)\n</code>The inner product or dot product, <code>np.inner(A, B)</code> or <code>np.dot(A, B)</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('i,i-&gt;', A, B) # or just use 'i,i'\n</code>The outer product, <code>np.outer(A, B)</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('i,j-&gt;ij', A, B)\n</code>\nFor 2D arrays, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, provided that the axes are compatible lengths (both the same length or one of them of has length 1), here are a few examples:The trace of <code>C</code> (sum of main diagonal), <code>np.trace(C)</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('ii', C)\n</code>Element-wise multiplication of <code>C</code> and the transpose of <code>D</code>, <code>C * D.T</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('ij,ji-&gt;ij', C, D)\n</code>Multiplying each element of <code>C</code> by the array <code>D</code> (to make a 4D array), <code>C[:, :, None, None] * D</code>, can be written:\n<code>np.einsum('ij,kl-&gt;ijkl', C, D)    \n</code>", "I found NumPy: The tricks of the trade (Part II) instructive\n  We use -> to indicate the order of the output array. So think of 'ij, i->j' as having left hand side (LHS) and right hand side (RHS). Any repetition of labels on the LHS computes the product element wise and then sums over. By changing the label on the RHS (output) side, we can define the axis in which we want to proceed with respect to the input array, i.e. summation along axis 0, 1 and so on.\n<code>import numpy as np&gt;&gt;&gt; a\narray([[1, 1, 1],\n       [2, 2, 2],\n       [3, 3, 3]])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\narray([[0, 1, 2],\n       [3, 4, 5],\n       [6, 7, 8]])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = np.einsum('ij, jk-&gt;ki', a, b)\n</code>Notice there are three axes, i, j, k, and that j is repeated (on the left-hand-side).  <code>i,j</code> represent rows and columns for <code>a</code>. <code>j,k</code> for <code>b</code>.In order to calculate the product and align the <code>j</code> axis we need to add an axis to <code>a</code>.

So <code>make_bold</code> decorated the result of the <code>make_italic</code> decorator, which decorated the <code>hello</code> function.The <code>@decorator</code> syntax is really just syntactic sugar; the following:<code>@decorator\ndef decorated_function():\n    # ...\n</code>is really executed as:<code>def decorated_function():\n    # ...\ndecorated_function = decorator(decorated_function)\n</code>replacing the original <code>decorated_function</code> object with whatever <code>decorator()</code> returned.Stacking decorators repeats that process outward.So your sample:<code>@make_bold\n@make_italic\ndef hello():\n  return \"hello world\"\n</code>can be expanded to:<code>def hello():\n  return \"hello world\"\nhello = make_bold(make_italic(hello))\n</code>When you call <code>hello()</code> now, you are calling the object returned by <code>make_bold()</code>, really. <code>make_bold()</code> returned a <code>lambda</code> that calls the function <code>make_bold</code> wrapped, which is the return value of <code>make_italic()</code>, which is also a lambda that calls the original <code>hello()</code>. Expanding all these calls you get:<code>hello() = lambda : \"&lt;b&gt;\" + fn() + \"&lt;/b&gt;\" #  where fn() -&gt;\n    lambda : \"&lt;i&gt;\" + fn() + \"&lt;/i&gt;\" # where fn() -&gt; \n        return \"hello world\"\n</code>so the output becomes:<code>\"&lt;b&gt;\" + (\"&lt;i&gt;\" + (\"hello world\") + \"&lt;/i&gt;\") + \"&lt;/b&gt;\"\n</code>", "I think the answer to this question seems straightforward but itsn't. When we talk about the decorator's order of execution I think we have to remember that the decorators themselves are evaluated at different moments during the execution: when the Python interpreter is evaluating the decorated method definition itself and when the decorated method is called/executed. The order of decorators as I could see in my experiments is different between these two phases.\nBesides, keep in mind that when decorating a function we could have code that executes before the decorated method and code that runs after. This makes things even more complicated when nesting decorators.\nSo, in a few words:When the interpreter is evaluating the decorated method definition the decorators are evaluated from bottom --&gt; top\nWhen the interpreter calls the decorated method the decorators are called from top --&gt; bottom.Consider the following code example:\n<code>print(&quot;========== Definition ==========&quot;)\ndef decorator(extra):\n    print(&quot; in decorator factory for %s &quot; % extra)\n    extra = &quot; %s&quot; % extra\n    def inner(func):\n        print(&quot; defining decorator %s &quot; % extra)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(&quot;before %s -- %s&quot; % (func.__name__, extra))\n            func(*args, **kwargs)\n            print(&quot;after %s -- %s&quot; % (func.__name__, extra))\n        return wrapper\n    return inner@decorator('first')\n@decorator('middle')\n@decorator('last')\ndef hello():\n    print('  Hello ')print(&quot;\\n========== Execution ==========&quot;)\nhello()\n</code>\nThe outtput of this code is the following:\n<code>========== Definition ==========\n in decorator factory for first \n in decorator factory for middle \n in decorator factory for last \n defining decorator  last \n defining decorator  middle \n defining decorator  first ========== Execution ==========\nbefore wrapper --  first\nbefore wrapper --  middle\nbefore hello --  last\n  Hello \nafter hello --  last\nafter wrapper --  middle\nafter wrapper --  first\n</code>\nAs we can see in this output the order is different (as explained before). During the definition, decorators are evaluated from bottom to top meanwhile during the execution (which is the most important part in general) they are evaluated from top to bottom.\nGoing back the example proposed in the question, following is a sample code (without using lambda):\n<code>print(&quot;========== Definition ==========&quot;)\ndef make_bold(fn):\n    print(&quot;make_bold decorator&quot;)\n    def wrapper():\n        print(&quot;bold&quot;)\n        return &quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot; + fn() + &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapperdef make_italic(fn):\n    print(&quot;make_italic decorator&quot;)\n    def wrapper():\n        print(&quot;italic&quot;)\n        return &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + fn() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\n    return wrapper@make_bold\n@make_italic\ndef hello():\n  return &quot;hello world&quot;print(&quot;\\n========== Execution ==========&quot;)\nprint(hello())\n</code>\nThe output in this case:\n<code>========== Definition ==========\nmake_italic decorator\nmake_bold decorator========== Execution ==========\nbold\nitalic\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;hello world&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n</code>\nNewly the order of execution is from top to bottom. We can apply the same to the original code (a little bit modified to print where are we):\n<code>print(&quot;========== Definition ==========&quot;)def make_bold(fn):\n    print(&quot;make_bold&quot;)\n    return lambda: print(&quot;exec_bold&quot;) or &quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot; + fn() + &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;def make_italic(fn):\n    print(&quot;make_italic&quot;)\n    return lambda: print(&quot;exec_italic&quot;) or &quot;&lt;i&gt;&quot; + fn() + &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;@make_bold\n@make_italic\ndef hello():\n  return &quot;hello world&quot;print(&quot;\\n========== Execution ==========&quot;)\nprint(hello())\n</code>\nThe output is:\n<code>========== Definition ==========\nmake_italic\nmake_bold========== Execution ==========\nexec_bold\nexec_italic\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;hello world&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n</code>\nI hope this sheds some light on the decorators order in Python and how it's handled."], "score": ["204", "24"], "acce_score": ["153", "153"], "reward": [[4.325979232788086, -1.0, 0.4836956560611725], [1.8196126222610474, 1.0, -0.4945652186870575]], "sft_index": 0}

These operations include:<code>narrow()</code>, <code>view()</code>, <code>expand()</code> and <code>transpose()</code>For example: when you call <code>transpose()</code>, PyTorch doesn't generate a new tensor with a new layout, it just modifies meta information in the Tensor object so that the offset and stride describe the desired new shape. In this example, the transposed tensor and original tensor share the same memory:\n<code>x = torch.randn(3,2)\ny = torch.transpose(x, 0, 1)\nx[0, 0] = 42\nprint(y[0,0])\n# prints 42\n</code>\nThis is where the concept of contiguous comes in. In the example above, <code>x</code> is contiguous but <code>y</code> is not because its memory layout is different to that of a tensor of same shape made from scratch. Note that the word &quot;contiguous&quot; is a bit misleading because it's not that the content of the tensor is spread out around disconnected blocks of memory. Here bytes are still allocated in one block of memory but the order of the elements is different!\nWhen you call <code>contiguous()</code>, it actually makes a copy of the tensor such that the order of its elements in memory is the same as if it had been created from scratch with the same data.\nNormally you don't need to worry about this.

The values in <code>torch.LongTensor</code>, passed as <code>index</code>, specify which value to take from each 'row'. The dimension of the output tensor is same as the dimension of index tensor. Following illustration from the official docs explains it more clearly:(Note: In the illustration, indexing starts from 1 and not 0).\nIn first example, the dimension given is along rows (top to bottom), so for (1,1) position of <code>result</code>, it takes row value from the <code>index</code> for the <code>src</code> that is <code>1</code>. At (1,1) in source value is <code>1</code> so,  outputs <code>1</code> at (1,1) in <code>result</code>.\nSimilarly for (2,2) the row value from the index for <code>src</code> is  <code>3</code>. At (3,2) the value in <code>src</code> is <code>8</code> and hence outputs <code>8</code> and so on.\nSimilarly for second example, indexing is along columns, and hence at (2,2)  position of the <code>result</code>, the column value from the index for <code>src</code> is <code>3</code>, so at (2,3) from <code>src</code> ,<code>6</code> is taken and outputs to <code>result</code> at (2,2)", "@Ritesh and @cleros gave great answers (with lots of upvotes), but after reading them I was still a bit confused, and I know why. This post will perhaps help folks like me.\nFor these sorts of exercises with rows and columns I think it really helps to use a non-square object, so let's start with a larger 4x3 <code>source</code> (<code>torch.Size([4, 3])</code>) using <code>source = torch.tensor([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10,11,12]])</code>. This will give us\n<code>\\\\ This is the source tensor\ntensor([[ 1,  2,  3],\n        [ 4,  5,  6],\n        [ 7,  8,  9],\n        [10, 11, 12]])\n</code>\nNow let's start indexing along the columns (<code>dim=1</code>) and create <code>index = torch.tensor([[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[0,1]])</code>, which is a list of lists. Here's the key: since our dimension is columns, and the source has <code>4</code> rows, the <code>index</code> must contain <code>4</code> lists! We need a list for each row. Running <code>source.gather(dim=1, index=index)</code> will give us\n<code>tensor([[ 1,  1],\n        [ 5,  5],\n        [ 9,  9],\n        [10, 11]])\n</code>\nSo, each list within <code>index</code> gives us the columns from which to pull the values. The 1st list of the <code>index</code> (<code>[0,0]</code>) is telling us to take to look at the 1st row of the <code>source</code> and take the 1st column of that row (it's zero-indexed) twice, which is <code>[1,1]</code>. The 2nd list of the <code>index</code> (<code>[1,1]</code>) is telling us to take to look at the 2nd row of <code>source</code> and take the 2nd column of that row twice, which is <code>[5,5]</code>. Jumping to the 4th list of the <code>index</code> (<code>[0,1]</code>), which is asking us to look at the 4th and final row of the <code>source</code>, is asking us to take the 1st column (<code>10</code>) and then the 2nd column (<code>11</code>) which gives us <code>[10,11]</code>.\nHere's a nifty thing: each list of your <code>index</code> has to be the same length, but they may be as long as you like! For example, with <code>index = torch.tensor([[0,1,2,1,0],[2,1,0,1,2],[1,2,0,2,1],[1,0,2,0,1]])</code>, <code>source.gather(dim=1, index=index)</code> will give us\n<code>tensor([[ 1,  2,  3,  2,  1],\n        [ 6,  5,  4,  5,  6],\n        [ 8,  9,  7,  9,  8],\n        [11, 10, 12, 10, 11]])\n</code>\nThe output will always have the same number of rows as the <code>source</code>, but the number of columns will equal the length of each list in <code>index</code>. For example, the 2nd list of the <code>index</code> (<code>[2,1,0,1,2]</code>) is going to the 2nd row of the <code>source</code> and pulling, respectively, the 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 2nd and 3rd items, which is <code>[6,5,4,5,6]</code>. Note, the value of every element in <code>index</code> has to be less than the number of columns of <code>source</code> (in this case <code>3</code>), otherwise you get an <code>out of bounds</code> error.\nSwitching to <code>dim=0</code>, we'll now be using the rows as opposed to the columns. Using the same <code>source</code>, we now need an <code>index</code> where the length of each list equals the number of columns in the <code>source</code>. Why? Because each element in the list represents the row from <code>source</code> as we move column by column.\nTherefore, <code>index = torch.tensor([[0,0,0],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[3,2,0]])</code> will then have <code>source.gather(dim=0, index=index)</code> give us\n<code>tensor([[ 1,  2,  3],\n        [ 1,  5,  9],\n        [ 4,  8, 12],\n        [10,  8,  3]])\n</code>\nLooking at the 1st list in the <code>index</code> (<code>[0,0,0]</code>), we can see that we're moving across the 3 columns of <code>source</code> picking the 1st element (it's zero-indexed) of each column, which is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. The 2nd list in the <code>index</code> (<code>[0,1,2]</code>) tells us to move across the columns taking the 1st, 2nd and 3rd items, respectively, which is <code>[1,5,9]</code>. And so on.\nWith <code>dim=1</code> our <code>index</code> had to have a number of lists equal to the number of rows in the <code>source</code>,  but each list could be as long, or short, as you like. With <code>dim=0</code>, each list in our <code>index</code> has to be the same length as the number of columns in the <code>source</code>, but we can now have as many lists as we like. Each value in <code>index</code>, however, needs to be less than the number of row in <code>source</code> (in this case <code>4</code>).\nFor example, <code>index = torch.tensor([[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[3,2,0]])</code> would have <code>source.gather(dim=0, index=index)</code> give us\n<code>tensor([[ 1,  2,  3],\n        [ 4,  5,  6],\n        [ 7,  8,  9],\n        [10, 11, 12],\n        [ 1,  5,  9],\n        [ 4,  8, 12],\n        [10,  8,  3]])\n</code>\nWith <code>dim=1</code> the output always has the same number of rows as the <code>source</code>, although the number of columns will equal the length of the lists in <code>index</code>. The number of lists in <code>index</code> has to equal the number of rows in <code>source</code>. Each value in <code>index</code>, however, needs to be less than the number of columns in <code>source</code>.\nWith <code>dim=0</code> the output always has the same number of columns as the <code>source</code>, but the number of rows will equal the number of lists in <code>index</code>. The length of each list in <code>index</code> has to equal the number of columns in <code>source</code>. Each value in <code>index</code>, however, needs to be less than the number of row in <code>source</code>.\nThat's it for two dimensions.

Breaking the iterable into chunks performs better than passing each item in the iterable between processes one item at a time - particularly if the iterable is large. However, turning the iterable into a list in order to chunk it can have a very high memory cost, since the entire list will need to be kept in memory. <code>imap</code> doesn't turn the iterable you give it into a list, nor does break it into chunks (by default). It will iterate over the iterable one element at a time, and send them each to a worker process. This means you don't take the memory hit of converting the whole iterable to a list, but it also means the performance is slower for large iterables, because of the lack of chunking. This can be mitigated by passing a <code>chunksize</code> argument larger than default of 1, however.The other major difference between <code>imap</code>/<code>imap_unordered</code> and <code>map</code>/<code>map_async</code>, is that with <code>imap</code>/<code>imap_unordered</code>, you can start receiving results from workers as soon as they're ready, rather than having to wait for all of them to be finished. With <code>map_async</code>, an <code>AsyncResult</code> is returned right away, but you can't actually retrieve results from that object until all of them have been processed, at which points it returns the same list that <code>map</code> does (<code>map</code> is actually implemented internally as <code>map_async(...).get()</code>). There's no way to get partial results; you either have the entire result, or nothing.<code>imap</code> and <code>imap_unordered</code> both return iterables right away. With <code>imap</code>, the results will be yielded from the iterable as soon as they're ready, while still preserving the ordering of the input iterable. With <code>imap_unordered</code>, results will be yielded as soon as they're ready, regardless of the order of the input iterable. So, say you have this:<code>import multiprocessing\nimport timedef func(x):\n    time.sleep(x)\n    return x + 2if __name__ == \"__main__\":    \n    p = multiprocessing.Pool()\n    start = time.time()\n    for x in p.imap(func, [1,5,3]):\n        print(\"{} (Time elapsed: {}s)\".format(x, int(time.time() - start)))\n</code>This will output:<code>3 (Time elapsed: 1s)\n7 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n5 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n</code>If you use <code>p.imap_unordered</code> instead of <code>p.imap</code>, you'll see:<code>3 (Time elapsed: 1s)\n5 (Time elapsed: 3s)\n7 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n</code>If you use <code>p.map</code> or <code>p.map_async().get()</code>, you'll see:<code>3 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n7 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n5 (Time elapsed: 5s)\n</code>So, the primary reasons to use <code>imap</code>/<code>imap_unordered</code> over <code>map_async</code> are:\nYour iterable is large enough that converting it to a list would cause you to run out of/use too much memory.\nYou want to be able to start processing the results before all of them are completed.", "The accepted answer states that for <code>imap_unordered</code> &quot;results will be yielded as soon as they're ready&quot; where one might possibly infer that results will be returned in the order of completion. But I just want to make it clear that this is not true in general. The documentation states that the results are returned in arbitrary order. Consider the following program that uses a pool size of 4, an iterable size of 20 and a chunksize value of 5. The worker function sleeps a variable amount of time depending on its passed argument, which also ensures that no one process in the pool grabs all the submitted tasks. Thus I expect each process in the pool to have <code>20 / 4 = 5</code> tasks to process:\n<code>from multiprocessing import Pool\nimport timedef worker(x):\n    print(f'x = {x}', flush=True)\n    time.sleep(.1 * (20 - x))\n    # return approximate completion time with passed argument:\n    return time.time(), xif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pool = Pool(4)\n    results = pool.imap_unordered(worker, range(20), chunksize=5)\n    for t, x in results:\n        print('result:', t, x)\n</code>\nPrints:\n<code>x = 0\nx = 5\nx = 10\nx = 15\nx = 16\nx = 17\nx = 11\nx = 18\nx = 19\nx = 6\nresult: 1621512513.7737606 15\nresult: 1621512514.1747007 16\nresult: 1621512514.4758775 17\nresult: 1621512514.675989 18\nresult: 1621512514.7766125 19\nx = 12\nx = 1\nx = 13\nx = 7\nx = 14\nx = 2\nresult: 1621512514.2716103 10\nresult: 1621512515.1721854 11\nresult: 1621512515.9727488 12\nresult: 1621512516.6744206 13\nresult: 1621512517.276999 14\nx = 8\nx = 9\nx = 3\nresult: 1621512514.7695887 5\nresult: 1621512516.170747 6\nresult: 1621512517.4713914 7\nresult: 1621512518.6734042 8\nresult: 1621512519.7743165 9\nx = 4\nresult: 1621512515.268784 0\nresult: 1621512517.1698637 1\nresult: 1621512518.9698756 2\nresult: 1621512520.671273 3\nresult: 1621512522.2716706 4\n</code>\nYou can plainly see that these results are not being yielded in completion order. For example, I have been returned <code>1621512519.7743165 9</code> followed by <code>1621512515.268784 0</code>, which was returned by the worker function more than 4 seconds earlier than the previously returned result.  However, if I change the chunksize value to 1, the printout becmomes:\n<code>x = 0\nx = 1\nx = 2\nx = 3\nx = 4\nresult: 1621513028.888357 3\nx = 5\nresult: 1621513028.9863524 2\nx = 6\nresult: 1621513029.0838938 1\nx = 7\nresult: 1621513029.1825204 0\nx = 8\nresult: 1621513030.4842813 7\nx = 9\nresult: 1621513030.4852195 6\nx = 10\nresult: 1621513030.4872172 5\nx = 11\nresult: 1621513030.4892178 4\nx = 12\nresult: 1621513031.3908074 11\nx = 13\nresult: 1621513031.4895358 10\nx = 14\nresult: 1621513031.587289 9\nx = 15\nresult: 1621513031.686152 8\nx = 16\nresult: 1621513032.1877549 15\nx = 17\nresult: 1621513032.1896958 14\nx = 18\nresult: 1621513032.1923752 13\nx = 19\nresult: 1621513032.1923752 12\nresult: 1621513032.2935638 19\nresult: 1621513032.3927407 18\nresult: 1621513032.4912949 17\nresult: 1621513032.5884912 16\n</code>\nThis is in completion order. However, I hesitate to state that <code>imap_unordered</code> will always return results as they become available if a chunksize value of 1 is specified, although that appears to be the case based on this experiment, since the documentation makes no such claim.\nDiscussion\nWhen a chunksize of 5 is specified, the 20 tasks are placed on a single input queue for the 4 processes in the pool to process in chunks of size 5. So a process that becomes idle will take off the queue the next chunk of 5 tasks and process each one of them in turn before becoming idle again. Thus the first process will be processing <code>x</code> arguments 0 through 4, the second process <code>x</code> arguments 5 through 9, etc. This is why you see the initial <code>x</code> values printed as 0, 5, 10 and 15.\nBut while the result for <code>x</code> argument 0 completes before the result for <code>x</code> argument 9, it would appear that results get written out together as chunks and therefore the result for <code>x</code> argument 0 will not get returned until the results for the <code>x</code> arguments that were queued up in the same chunk (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and 4) are also available."], "score": ["700", "16"], "acce_score": ["263", "263"], "reward": [[0.3890099823474884, 0.6939130425453186, 1.0], [1.4412928819656372, -0.4444444477558136, -0.5598631501197815]], "sft_index": 0}

It looks like this:In the computer's memory, the values of <code>arr</code> are stored like this:This means <code>arr</code> is a C contiguous array because the rows are stored as contiguous blocks of memory. The next memory address holds the next row value on that row. If we want to move down a column, we just need to jump over three blocks (e.g. to jump from 0 to 4 means we skip over 1,2 and 3).Transposing the array with <code>arr.T</code> means that C contiguity is lost because adjacent row entries are no longer in adjacent memory addresses. However, <code>arr.T</code> is Fortran contiguous since the columns are in contiguous blocks of memory:Performance-wise, accessing memory addresses which are next to each other is very often faster than accessing addresses which are more \"spread out\" (fetching a value from RAM could entail a number of neighbouring addresses being fetched and cached for the CPU.) This means that operations over contiguous arrays will often be quicker.As a consequence of C contiguous memory layout, row-wise operations are usually faster than column-wise operations. For example, you'll typically find that <code>np.sum(arr, axis=1) # sum the rows\n</code>is slightly faster than:<code>np.sum(arr, axis=0) # sum the columns\n</code>Similarly, operations on columns will be slightly faster for Fortran contiguous arrays.Finally, why can't we flatten the Fortran contiguous array by assigning a new shape?<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; arr2 = arr.T\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arr2.shape = 12\nAttributeError: incompatible shape for a non-contiguous array\n</code>In order for this to be possible NumPy would have to put the rows of <code>arr.T</code> together like this:(Setting the <code>shape</code> attribute directly assumes C order - i.e. NumPy tries to perform the operation row-wise.)This is impossible to do. For any axis, NumPy needs to have a constant stride length (the number of bytes to move) to get to the next element of the array. Flattening <code>arr.T</code> in this way would require skipping forwards and backwards in memory to retrieve consecutive values of the array.If we wrote <code>arr2.reshape(12)</code> instead, NumPy would copy the values of arr2 into a new block of memory (since it can't return a view on to the original data for this shape).", "Maybe this example with 12 different array values will help:<code>In [207]: x=np.arange(12).reshape(3,4).copy()In [208]: x.flags\nOut[208]: \n  C_CONTIGUOUS : True\n  F_CONTIGUOUS : False\n  OWNDATA : True\n  ...\nIn [209]: x.T.flags\nOut[209]: \n  C_CONTIGUOUS : False\n  F_CONTIGUOUS : True\n  OWNDATA : False\n  ...\n</code>The <code>C order</code> values are in the order that they were generated in.  The transposed ones are not<code>In [212]: x.reshape(12,)   # same as x.ravel()\nOut[212]: array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11])In [213]: x.T.reshape(12,)\nOut[213]: array([ 0,  4,  8,  1,  5,  9,  2,  6, 10,  3,  7, 11])\n</code>You can get 1d views of both<code>In [214]: x1=x.TIn [217]: x.shape=(12,)\n</code>the shape of <code>x</code> can also be changed.<code>In [220]: x1.shape=(12,)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-220-cf2b1a308253&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n----&gt; 1 x1.shape=(12,)AttributeError: incompatible shape for a non-contiguous array\n</code>But the shape of the transpose cannot be changed.  The <code>data</code> is still in the <code>0,1,2,3,4...</code> order, which can't be accessed accessed as <code>0,4,8...</code> in a 1d array.But a copy of <code>x1</code> can be changed:<code>In [227]: x2=x1.copy()In [228]: x2.flags\nOut[228]: \n  C_CONTIGUOUS : True\n  F_CONTIGUOUS : False\n  OWNDATA : True\n  ...\nIn [229]: x2.shape=(12,)\n</code>Looking at <code>strides</code> might also help.  A strides is how far (in bytes) it has to step to get to the next value.  For a 2d array, there will be be 2 stride values:<code>In [233]: x=np.arange(12).reshape(3,4).copy()In [234]: x.strides\nOut[234]: (16, 4)\n</code>To get to the next row, step 16 bytes, next column only 4.<code>In [235]: x1.strides\nOut[235]: (4, 16)\n</code>Transpose just switches the order of the strides.  The next row is only 4 bytes- i.e. the next number.    <code>In [236]: x.shape=(12,)In [237]: x.strides\nOut[237]: (4,)\n</code>Changing the shape also changes the strides - just step through the buffer 4 bytes at a time.<code>In [238]: x2=x1.copy()In [239]: x2.strides\nOut[239]: (12, 4)\n</code>Even though <code>x2</code> looks just like <code>x1</code>, it has its own data buffer, with the values in a different order.  The next column is now 4 bytes over, while the next row is 12 (3*4).<code>In [240]: x2.shape=(12,)In [241]: x2.strides\nOut[241]: (4,)\n</code>And as with <code>x</code>, changing the shape to 1d reduces the strides to <code>(4,)</code>.  For <code>x1</code>, with data in the <code>0,1,2,...</code> order, there isn't a 1d stride that would give <code>0,4,8...</code>.<code>__array_interface__</code> is another useful way of displaying array information:<code>In [242]: x1.__array_interface__\nOut[242]: \n{'strides': (4, 16),\n 'typestr': '&lt;i4',\n 'shape': (4, 3),\n 'version': 3,\n 'data': (163336056, False),\n 'descr': [('', '&lt;i4')]}\n</code>The <code>x1</code> data buffer address will be same as for <code>x</code>, with which it shares the data.  <code>x2</code> has a different buffer address.You could also experiment with adding a <code>order='F'</code> parameter to the <code>copy</code> and <code>reshape</code> commands."], "score": ["367", "21"], "acce_score": ["176", "176"], "reward": [[2.7269484996795654, -0.475862056016922, 0.6111850738525391], [0.608452558517456, -0.3142857253551483, -0.31025299429893494]], "sft_index": 0}

Did you mean print(\"Hello!\")?\n</code>Since the \"Missing parentheses in call to print\" case is a compile time syntax error and hence has access to the raw source code, it's able to include the full text on the rest of the line in the suggested replacement. However, it doesn't currently try to work out the appropriate quotes to place around that expression (that's not impossible, just sufficiently complicated that it hasn't been done).The <code>TypeError</code> raised for the right shift operator has also been customised:<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &gt;&gt;: 'builtin_function_or_method' and '_io.TextIOWrapper'.

I was also doing plots with a common sub-plot containing reference data, so I wanted the color sequence to be consistently repeatable.\nI initially tried simply generating colors randomly, reseeding the RNG before each plot.  This worked OK (commented-out in code below), but could generate nearly indistinguishable colors.  I wanted highly contrasting colors, ideally sampled from a colormap containing all colors.\nI could have as many as 31 data series in a single plot, so I chopped the colormap into that many steps.  Then I walked the steps in an order that ensured I wouldn't return to the neighborhood of a given color very soon.\nMy data is in a highly irregular time series, so I wanted to see the points and the lines, with the point having the 'opposite' color of the line.\nGiven all the above, it was easiest to generate a dictionary with the relevant parameters for plotting the individual series, then expand it as part of the call.\nHere's my code.  Perhaps not pretty, but functional.\n<code>from matplotlib import cm\ncmap = cm.get_cmap('gist_rainbow')  #('hsv') #('nipy_spectral')max_colors = 31   # Constant, max mumber of series in any plot.

Could someone explain what the difference is between a OneToOne, ManyToMany and ForeignKey?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["Well, there's essentially two questions here:\nWhat is the difference (in general) between one to one, many to many, and foreign key relations\nWhat are their differences specific to Django. \nBoth of these questions are quite easily answered through a simple Google search, but as I cannot find an exact dupe of this question on SO, I'll go ahead and answer.Note that in Django, relationships should only be defined on one side of the relationship.ForeignKeyA foreign key relationship is generally known as a many-to-one relationship. Note that the reverse of this relationship is one-to-many (which Django provides tools to access). As the name implies, many objects may be related to one.<code>Person &gt;--| Birthplace\n   ^           ^\n   |           |\n  Many        One \n</code>In this example, a person may only have one birthplace, but a birthplace may be related to many people. Let's look at this example in Django. Say these are our models:<code>class Birthplace(models.Model):\n    city = models.CharField(max_length=75)\n    state = models.CharField(max_length=25)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.city, \", \", self.state)class Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    birthplace = models.ForeignKey(Birthplace)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.name\n</code>You can see that no relations are defined within the <code>Birthplace</code> model, and a <code>ForeignKey</code> relationship is defined within the <code>Person</code> model. Say that we create the following instances of our models (obviously not in Python syntax):\nBirthplace: Dallas, Texas\nBirthplace: New York City, New York\nPerson: John Smith, Birthplace : (Dallas, Texas)\nPerson: Maria Lee, Birthplace : (Dallas, Texas)\nPerson: Daniel Lee, Birthplace : (New York City, New York)\nNow we can see how Django lets us use these relations (note that <code>./manage.py shell</code> is your friend!):<code>&gt;&gt; from somewhere.models import Birthplace, Person\n&gt;&gt; Person.objects.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;, &lt;Person: Daniel Lee&gt;]\n&gt;&gt; Birthplace.objects.all()\n[&lt;Birthplace: Dallas, Texas&gt;, &lt;Birthplace: New York City, New York&gt;]\n</code>You can see the model instances we created. Now let's checkout someone's birthplace:<code>&gt;&gt; person = Person.object.get(name=\"John Smith\")\n&gt;&gt; person.birthplace\n&lt;Birthplace: Dallas, Texas&gt;\n&gt;&gt; person.birthplace.city\nDallas\n</code>Let's say you want to see all people with a given birthplace. As I said earlier, Django allows you to access reverse relations. By default, Django creates a manager (<code>RelatedManager</code>) on your model to handle this, named <code>&lt;model&gt;_set</code>, where <code>&lt;model&gt;</code> is your model name in lowercase.<code>&gt;&gt; place = Birthplace.objects.get(city=\"Dallas\")\n&gt;&gt; place.person_set.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;]\n</code>Note that we can change the name of this manager by setting the <code>related_name</code> keyword argument in our model relation. So, we would change the <code>birthplace</code> field in the <code>Person</code> model to:<code>birthplace = models.ForeignKey(Birthplace, related_name=\"people\")\n</code>Now, we can access that reverse relationship with a pretty name:<code>&gt;&gt; place.people.all()\n[&lt;Person: John Smith&gt;, &lt;Person: Maria Lee&gt;]\n</code>One-to-oneA one-to-one relationship is quite similar to a many-to-one relationship, except that it restricts two objects to having a unique relationship. An example of this would be a User and a Profile (which stores information about the user). No two users share the same profile. <code>User |--| Profile\n  ^          ^\n  |          |\n One        One\n</code>Let's look at this in Django. I won't bother to define the user model, as Django defines it for us. Do note, however, that Django suggests using <code>django.contrib.auth.get_user_model()</code> to import the user, so that's what we'll do. The profile model may be defined as follows:<code>class Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL) # Note that Django suggests getting the User from the settings for relationship definitions\n    fruit = models.CharField(max_length=50, help_text=\"Favorite Fruit\")\n    facebook = models.CharField(max_length=100, help_text=\"Facebook Username\")    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.fruit, \" \", self.facebook)\n</code>All we need is one user with a profile to test this out in the shell:\nUser: johndt6\nProfile: user : johndt6, \"Kiwi\", \"blah_blah\"\nNow you may easily access the user's profile from the User model:<code>&gt;&gt; user = User.objects.all()[0]\n&gt;&gt; user.username\njohndt6\n&gt;&gt; user.profile\n&lt;Profile: Kiwi blah_blah&gt;\n&gt;&gt; user.profile.fruit\nKiwi\n&gt;&gt; profile = Profile.objects.get(user=user)\n&gt;&gt; profile.user\n&lt;User: johndt6&gt;\n</code>Of course, you may customize the name of the reverse relation using the <code>related_name</code> argument as above.Many-to-manyMany-to-many relationships can be a bit tricky. Let me start by saying that many-to-many fields are messy, and should be avoided when possible. Given that, there are plenty of situations where a many-to-many relationship makes sense.A many-to-many relationship between two models defines that zero, one or more objects of the first model may be related to zero, one or more objects of the second model. As an example, let's envision a company that defines their workflow through projects. A project may be related to no orders, only one order, or many orders. An order may be related to no projects, one project, or many. <code>Order &gt;--&lt; Project\n  ^           ^\n  |           |\n Many        Many\n</code>Let's define our models as so:<code>class Order(models.Model):\n    product = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # Note that in reality, this would probably be better served by a Product model\n    customer = models.CharField(max_length=150)  # The same may be said for customers    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(self.product, \" for \", self.customer)class Project(models.Model):\n    orders = models.ManyToManyField(Order)    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"\".join(\"Project \", str(self.id))\n</code>Note that Django will create a <code>RelatedManager</code> for the <code>orders</code> field to access the many-to-many relationship.Let's create the following instances of our models (in my inconsistent syntax!):\nOrder: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\"\nOrder: \"Submarine\", \"US Navy\"\nOrder: \"Race car\", \"NASCAR\"\nProject: orders: []\nProject: orders: [(Order: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\")]\nProject: orders: [(Order: \"Spaceship\", \"NASA\"), (Order: \"Race car\", \"NASCAR\")]\nWe can access these relationships as follows:<code>&gt;&gt; Project.objects.all()\n[&lt;Project: Project 0&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 1&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 2&gt;]\n&gt;&gt; for proj in Project.objects.all():\n..     print(proj)\n..     proj.orders.all()  # Note that we must access the `orders`\n..                        # field through its manager\n..     print(\"\")\nProject 0\n[]Project 1\n[&lt;Order: Spaceship for NASA&gt;]Project 2\n[&lt;Order: Spaceship for NASA&gt;, &lt;Order: Race car for NASCAR&gt;]\n</code>Note that the NASA order is related to 2 projects, and the US Navy order is related to none. Also note that one project has no orders, and one has multiple.We may also access the relationship in reverse in the same way we have before:<code>&gt;&gt; order = Order.objects.filter(customer=\"NASA\")[0]\n&gt;&gt; order.project_set.all()\n[&lt;Project: Project 0&gt;, &lt;Project: Project 2&gt;]\n</code>ASCII Cardinality GuideIn the likely case that my ASCII diagrams are a bit confusing, the following explanations might be helpful:\n<code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;</code> means \"to many\"\n<code>|</code> means \"to one\"\nSo... <code>A --| B</code> means an instance of A can be related to only ONE instance of B.And <code>A --&lt; B</code> means an instance of A can be related to MANY instances of B.<code>A &gt;--&lt; B</code> is equivalent to....<code>A --&lt; B\nA &gt;-- B\n</code>Thus, each \"side\" or direction of the relationship can be read separately. It's just convenient to squish them together.Expanding one of these relationships might make more sense:<code>               +---- John Smith\n               |\n Dallas|-------+---- Jane Doe\n               |\n               +---- Joe Smoe\n</code>ResourcesGood explanation of db relationships provided by @MarcBWikipedia page on CardinalityDjango Docs:<code>models.ForeignKey</code><code>models.OneToOneField</code><code>models.ManyToManyField</code>One-to-one RelationshipsMany-to-many Relationships", "In my point of View the diff b/w One-To-One &amp; One-To-Many is\nOne-To-One : it means one person can contain one passport only\nOne-To-Many : it means one person can contain many address like(permanent address, Office address, Secondary Address)\nif you call the parent model it will automatically call the many child class"], "score": ["278", "0"], "acce_score": ["101", "101"], "reward": [[-0.03938829526305199, -0.757709264755249, 0.8599106073379517], [-6.698796272277832, -1.0, 0.03129657357931137]], "sft_index": 0}

Because a subtle difference in\nthe order of indexing makes a big difference in behavior, it is better to use single indexing assignment:<code>df.iloc[0, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x\n</code><code>df.iloc[0, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x</code> (recommended):The recommended way to assign new values to a\nDataFrame is to avoid chained indexing, and instead use the method shown by\nandrew,<code>df.loc[df.index[n], 'Btime'] = x\n</code>or <code>df.iloc[n, df.columns.get_loc('Btime')] = x\n</code>The latter method is a bit faster, because <code>df.loc</code> has to convert the row and column labels to\npositional indices, so there is a little less conversion necessary if you use\n<code>df.iloc</code> instead.<code>df['Btime'].iloc[0] = x</code> works, but is not recommended:Although this works, it is taking advantage of the way DataFrames are currently implemented. There is no guarantee that Pandas has to work this way in the future. In particular, it is taking advantage of the fact that (currently) <code>df['Btime']</code> always returns a\nview (not a copy) so <code>df['Btime'].iloc[n] = x</code> can be used to assign a new value\nat the nth location of the <code>Btime</code> column of <code>df</code>.Since Pandas makes no explicit guarantees about when indexers return a view versus a copy, assignments that use chained indexing generally always raise a <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code> even though in this case the assignment succeeds in modifying <code>df</code>:<code>In [22]: df = pd.DataFrame({'foo':list('ABC')}, index=[0,2,1])\nIn [24]: df['bar'] = 100\nIn [25]: df['bar'].iloc[0] = 99\n/home/unutbu/data/binky/bin/ipython:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrameSee the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy\n  self._setitem_with_indexer(indexer, value)In [26]: df\nOut[26]: \n  foo  bar\n0   A   99  &lt;-- assignment succeeded\n2   B  100\n1   C  100\n</code><code>df.iloc[0]['Btime'] = x</code> does not work:In contrast, assignment with <code>df.iloc[0]['bar'] = 123</code> does not work because <code>df.iloc[0]</code> is returning a copy:<code>In [66]: df.iloc[0]['bar'] = 123\n/home/unutbu/data/binky/bin/ipython:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrameSee the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copyIn [67]: df\nOut[67]: \n  foo  bar\n0   A   99  &lt;-- assignment failed\n2   B  100\n1   C  100\n</code>Warning: I had previously suggested <code>df_test.ix[i, 'Btime']</code>. But this is not guaranteed to give you the <code>ith</code> value since <code>ix</code> tries to index by label before trying to index by position. So if the DataFrame has an integer index which is not in sorted order starting at 0, then using <code>ix[i]</code> will return the row labeled <code>i</code> rather than the <code>ith</code> row. For example,<code>In [1]: df = pd.DataFrame({'foo':list('ABC')}, index=[0,2,1])In [2]: df\nOut[2]: \n  foo\n0   A\n2   B\n1   CIn [4]: df.ix[1, 'foo']\nOut[4]: 'C'\n</code>", "To access a single value you can use the method <code>iat</code> that is much faster than <code>iloc</code>:\n<code>df['Btime'].iat[0]\n</code>\nYou can also use the method <code>take</code>:\n<code>df['Btime'].take(0)\n</code>"], "score": ["800", "12"], "acce_score": ["506", "506"], "reward": [[-0.7244345545768738, 1.0, 0.933742344379425], [2.3852527141571045, 0.29411765933036804, -1.0]], "sft_index": 0}

You might be wondering why the type, DataFrame, got printed out twice. Pandas runs the first group twice. It does this to determine if there is a fast way to complete the computation or not. This is a minor detail that you shouldn't worry about.\nNow, let's do the same thing with <code>transform</code>\n<code>df.groupby('State').transform(inspect)\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.series.Series'&gt;\nRuntimeError\n</code>\nIt is passed a Series - a totally different Pandas object.\nSo, <code>transform</code> is only allowed to work with a single Series at a time. It is impossible for it to act on two columns at the same time. So, if we try and subtract column <code>a</code> from <code>b</code> inside of our custom function we would get an error with <code>transform</code>. See below:\n<code>def subtract_two(x):\n    return x['a'] - x['b']df.groupby('State').transform(subtract_two)\nKeyError: ('a', 'occurred at index a')\n</code>\nWe get a KeyError as pandas is attempting to find the Series index <code>a</code> which does not exist. You can complete this operation with <code>apply</code> as it has the entire DataFrame:\n<code>df.groupby('State').apply(subtract_two)State     \nFlorida  2   -2\n         3   -8\nTexas    0   -2\n         1   -5\ndtype: int64\n</code>\nThe output is a Series and a little confusing as the original index is kept, but we have access to all columns.Displaying the passed pandas object\nIt can help even more to display the entire pandas object within the custom function, so you can see exactly what you are operating with. You can use <code>print</code> statements by I like to use the <code>display</code> function from the <code>IPython.display</code> module so that the DataFrames get nicely outputted in HTML in a jupyter notebook:\n<code>from IPython.display import display\ndef subtract_two(x):\n    display(x)\n    return x['a'] - x['b']\n</code>\nScreenshot:\nTransform must return a single dimensional sequence the same size as the group\nThe other difference is that <code>transform</code> must return a single dimensional sequence the same size as the group. In this particular instance, each group has two rows, so <code>transform</code> must return a sequence of two rows. If it does not then an error is raised:\n<code>def return_three(x):\n    return np.array([1, 2, 3])df.groupby('State').transform(return_three)\nValueError: transform must return a scalar value for each group\n</code>\nThe error message is not really descriptive of the problem. You must return a sequence the same length as the group. So, a function like this would work:\n<code>def rand_group_len(x):\n    return np.random.rand(len(x))df.groupby('State').transform(rand_group_len)          a         b\n0  0.962070  0.151440\n1  0.440956  0.782176\n2  0.642218  0.483257\n3  0.056047  0.238208\n</code>Returning a single scalar object also works for <code>transform</code>\nIf you return just a single scalar from your custom function, then <code>transform</code> will use it for each of the rows in the group:\n<code>def group_sum(x):\n    return x.sum()df.groupby('State').transform(group_sum)   a   b\n0  9  16\n1  9  16\n2  4  14\n3  4  14\n</code>", "I am going to use a very simple snippet to illustrate the difference:<code>test = pd.DataFrame({'id':[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], 'price':[1,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,2]})\ngrouping = test.groupby('id')['price']\n</code>The DataFrame looks like this:<code>    id  price   \n0   1   1   \n1   2   2   \n2   3   3   \n3   1   2   \n4   2   3   \n5   3   1   \n6   1   3   \n7   2   1   \n8   3   2   \n</code>There are 3 customer IDs in this table, each customer made three transactions and paid 1,2,3 dollars each time. Now, I want to find the minimum payment made by each customer. There are two ways of doing it:\nUsing <code>apply</code>:grouping.min()\nThe return looks like this:<code>id\n1    1\n2    1\n3    1\nName: price, dtype: int64pandas.core.series.Series # return type\nInt64Index([1, 2, 3], dtype='int64', name='id') #The returned Series' index\n# lenght is 3\n</code>\nUsing <code>transform</code>:grouping.transform(min)\nThe return looks like this:<code>0    1\n1    1\n2    1\n3    1\n4    1\n5    1\n6    1\n7    1\n8    1\nName: price, dtype: int64pandas.core.series.Series # return type\nRangeIndex(start=0, stop=9, step=1) # The returned Series' index\n# length is 9    \n</code>Both methods return a <code>Series</code> object, but the <code>length</code> of the first one is 3 and the <code>length</code> of the second one is 9.If you want to answer <code>What is the minimum price paid by each customer</code>, then the <code>apply</code> method is the more suitable one to choose.If you want to answer <code>What is the difference between the amount paid for each transaction vs the minimum payment</code>, then you want to use <code>transform</code>, because:<code>test['minimum'] = grouping.transform(min) # ceates an extra column filled with minimum payment\ntest.price - test.minimum # returns the difference for each row\n</code><code>Apply</code> does not work here simply because it returns a Series of size 3, but the original df's length is 9.

If you want to concatenate 1-dimensional arrays as the rows of a 2-dimensional output, you need to expand their dimensionality.\nAs Jorge's answer points out, there is also the function <code>stack</code>, introduced in numpy 1.10:\n<code>numpy.stack( LIST, axis=0 )\n</code>\nThis takes the complementary approach: it creates a new view of each input array and adds an extra dimension (in this case, on the left, so each <code>n</code>-element 1D array becomes a 1-by-<code>n</code> 2D array) before concatenating. It will only work if all the input arrays have the same shape.\n<code>vstack</code> (or equivalently <code>row_stack</code>) is often an easier-to-use solution because it will take a sequence of 1- and/or 2-dimensional arrays and expand the dimensionality automatically where necessary and only where necessary, before concatenating the whole list together. Where a new dimension is required, it is added on the left. Again, you can concatenate a whole list at once without needing to iterate:\n<code>numpy.vstack( LIST )\n</code>\nThis flexible behavior is also exhibited by the syntactic shortcut <code>numpy.r_[ array1, ...., arrayN ]</code> (note the square brackets).  This is good for concatenating a few explicitly-named arrays but is no good for your situation because this syntax will not accept a sequence of arrays, like your <code>LIST</code>.\nThere is also an analogous function <code>column_stack</code> and shortcut <code>c_[...]</code>, for horizontal (column-wise) stacking, as well as an almost-analogous function <code>hstack</code>—although for some reason the latter is less flexible (it is stricter about input arrays' dimensionality, and tries to concatenate 1-D arrays end-to-end instead of treating them as columns).\nFinally, in the specific case of vertical stacking of 1-D arrays, the following also works:\n<code>numpy.array( LIST )\n</code>\n...because arrays can be constructed out of a sequence of other arrays, adding a new dimension to the beginning.", "I checked some of the methods for speed performance and find that there is no difference!\nThe only difference is that using some methods you must carefully check dimension.Timing:<code>|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|            | shape (10000)  |  shape (1,10000)  |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| np.concat  |    0.18280     |      0.17960      |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|  np.stack  |    0.21501     |      0.16465      |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| np.vstack  |    0.21501     |      0.17181      |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|  np.array  |    0.21656     |      0.16833      |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n</code>As you can see I tried 2 experiments - using <code>np.random.rand(10000)</code> and <code>np.random.rand(1, 10000)</code>\nAnd if we use 2d arrays than <code>np.stack</code> and <code>np.array</code> create additional dimension - result.shape is (1,10000,10000) and (10000,1,10000) so they need additional actions to avoid this.Code:<code>from time import perf_counter\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook\nimport numpy as np\nl = []\nfor i in tqdm_notebook(range(10000)):\n    new_np = np.random.rand(10000)\n    l.append(new_np)start = perf_counter()\nstack = np.stack(l, axis=0 )\nprint(f'np.stack: {perf_counter() - start:.5f}')start = perf_counter()\nvstack = np.vstack(l)\nprint(f'np.vstack: {perf_counter() - start:.5f}')start = perf_counter()\nwrap = np.array(l)\nprint(f'np.array: {perf_counter() - start:.5f}')start = perf_counter()\nl = [el.reshape(1,-1) for el in l]\nconc = np.concatenate(l, axis=0 )\nprint(f'np.concatenate: {perf_counter() - start:.5f}')\n</code>"], "score": ["253", "13"], "acce_score": ["188", "188"], "reward": [[2.563349485397339, -0.5568862557411194, 0.7305389046669006], [-2.609102725982666, -0.8604651093482971, -0.7065868377685547]], "sft_index": 0}

The difference from the other questions is that the main starting process is checked (runserver by default starts 2 processes, one as an observer for quick code reload):\n<code>import os \nfrom django.apps import AppConfigclass MyAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'app_name'    def ready(self):\n        if os.environ.get('RUN_MAIN'):\n            print(&quot;STARTUP AND EXECUTE HERE ONCE.&quot;)\n            # call here your code\n</code>\nAnother solution is avoiding the environ check but call --noreload to force only one process.\nAlternative method\nThe first question to answer is why we need to execute code once: usually we need to initialize some services, data in the database or something one-shot. The 90% of the time it is some database initialization or job queue.\nThe approach to use the AppConfig.ready() method is not reliable, not always reproducible in production and it cannot guarantee to be executed exactly once (but at least once that is not the same). To have something quite predictable and executed exactly one time the best approach is developing a Django BaseCommand and call it from a startup script.\nSo for example, we can code in your &quot;myapp&quot;, in the file &quot;app/management/commands/init_tasks.py&quot;:\n<code>from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand\nfrom project.apps.myapp.tasks import scheduler\nfrom project import logger, initialize_database_dataclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    help = &quot;Init scheduler or do some staff in the database.&quot;    def handle(self, *args, **options):\n        scheduler.reload_jobs()\n        initialize_database_data()\n        logger.info(&quot;Inited&quot;)\n</code>\nAnd finally we can have a start script &quot;Start.bat&quot; (in the example a windows batch) to setup the full application start:\n<code>start /b python manage.py qcluster\nstart /b python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\nstart /b python manage.py init_tasks\n</code>"], "score": ["346", "15"], "acce_score": ["245", "245"], "reward": [[0.16542962193489075, -0.5485008955001831, 0.7228915691375732], [0.7920854687690735, -0.7966101765632629, -0.27409639954566956]], "sft_index": 0}

I wanted highly contrasting colors, ideally sampled from a colormap containing all colors.\nI could have as many as 31 data series in a single plot, so I chopped the colormap into that many steps.

For most languages, most if not all implementations fall in one category, so one might save a few words saying the language is interpreted/compiled too, but it's still an important distinction, both because it aids understanding and because there are quite a few languages with usable implementations of both kinds (mostly in the realm of functional languages, see Haskell and ML). In addition, there are C interpreters and projects that attempt to compile a subset of Python to C or C++ code (and subsequently to machine code).Second, compilation is not restricted to ahead-of-time compilation to native machine code. A compiler is, more generally, a program that converts a program in one programming language into a program in another programming language (arguably, you can even have a compiler with the same input and output language if significant transformations are applied). And JIT compilers compile to native machine code at runtime, which can give speed very close to or even better than ahead of time compilation (depending on the benchmark and the quality of the implementations compared).But to stop nitpicking and answer the question you meant to ask: Practically (read: using a somewhat popular and mature implementation), Python is compiled. Not compiled to machine code ahead of time (i.e. \"compiled\" by the restricted and wrong, but alas common definition), \"only\" compiled to bytecode, but it's still compilation with at least some of the benefits. For example, the statement <code>a = b.c()</code> is compiled to a byte stream which, when \"disassembled\", looks somewhat like <code>load 0 (b); load_str 'c'; get_attr; call_function 0; store 1 (a)</code>. This is a simplification, it's actually less readable and a bit more low-level -  you can experiment with the standard library <code>dis</code> module and see what the real deal looks like. Interpreting this is faster than interpreting from a higher-level representation.That bytecode is either interpreted (note that there's a difference, both in theory and in practical performance, between interpreting directly and first compiling to some intermediate representation and interpret that), as with the reference implementation (CPython), or both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime, as with PyPy.", "It really depends on the implementation of the language being used! There is a common step in any implementation, though: your code is first compiled (translated) to intermediate code - something between your code and machine (binary) code - called bytecode (stored into .pyc files). Note that this is a one-time step that will not be repeated unless you modify your code.\nAnd that bytecode is executed every time you are running the program. How? Well, when we run the program, this bytecode (inside a .pyc file) is passed as input to a Virtual Machine (VM)1 - the runtime engine allowing our programs to be executed - that executes it.\nDepending on the language implementation, the VM will either interpret the bytecode (in the case of CPython2 implementation) or JIT-compile3 it (in the case of PyPy4 implementation).\nNotes:\n1 an emulation of a computer system\n2 a bytecode interpreter; the reference implementation of the language, written in C and Python - most widely used\n3 compilation that is being done during the execution of a program (at runtime)\n4 a bytecode JIT compiler; an alternative implementation to CPython, written in RPython (Restricted Python) - often runs faster than CPython"], "score": ["343", "5"], "acce_score": ["271", "271"], "reward": [[0.4528602659702301, -0.5590828657150269, 0.6355421543121338], [0.40097540616989136, -0.9661017060279846, -0.3825301229953766]], "sft_index": 0}

See the original vulnerability disclosure. By offsetting the hash with a random seed (set once at startup) attackers can no longer predict what keys will collide.You can set a fixed seed or disable the feature by setting the <code>PYTHONHASHSEED</code> environment variable; the default is <code>random</code> but you can set it to a fixed positive integer value, with <code>0</code> disabling the feature altogether.Python versions 2.7 and 3.2 have the feature disabled by default (use the <code>-R</code> switch or set <code>PYTHONHASHSEED=random</code> to enable it); it is enabled by default in Python 3.3 and up.If you were relying on the order of keys in a Python set, then don't.

It is possible to\n  access <code>__private</code> names from outside their class, just inconvenient and\n  fragile (it adds a dependency on the exact name of the superclass).\n  \n  The problem is that the author of a class may legitimately think \"this\n  attribute/method name should be private, only accessible from within\n  this class definition\" and use the <code>__private</code> convention. But later on,\n  a user of that class may make a subclass that legitimately needs\n  access to that name. So either the superclass has to be modified\n  (which may be difficult or impossible), or the subclass code has to\n  use manually mangled names (which is ugly and fragile at best).\n  \n  There's a concept in Python: \"we're all consenting adults here\". If\n  you use the <code>__private</code> form, who are you protecting the attribute from?\n  It's the responsibility of subclasses to use attributes from\n  superclasses properly, and it's the responsibility of superclasses to\n  document their attributes properly.\n  \n  It's better to use the single-leading-underscore convention,\n  <code>_internal</code>. \"This isn't name mangled at all; it just indicates to\n  others to \"be careful with this, it's an internal implementation\n  detail; don't touch it if you don't fully understand it\".

You can use any other type methods to find the locator. EDIT 1:I should mention that the <code>webdriver</code> will wait for a page to load by default. It does not wait for loading inside frames or for ajax requests. It means when you use <code>.get('url')</code>, your browser will wait until the page is completely loaded and then go to the next command in the code. But when you are posting an ajax request, <code>webdriver</code> does not wait and it's your responsibility to wait an appropriate amount of time for the page or a part of page to load; so there is a module named <code>expected_conditions</code>.", "How about putting WebDriverWait in While loop and catching the exceptions.<code>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\nfrom selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutExceptionbrowser = webdriver.Firefox()\nbrowser.get(\"url\")\ndelay = 3 # seconds\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        WebDriverWait(browser, delay).until(EC.presence_of_element_located(browser.find_element_by_id('IdOfMyElement')))\n        print \"Page is ready!\"\n        break # it will break from the loop once the specific element will be present. \n    except TimeoutException:\n        print \"Loading took too much time!-Try again\"\n</code>"], "score": ["440", "6"], "acce_score": ["326", "326"], "reward": [[-3.379892110824585, -0.7162162065505981, 0.75], [0.4115133285522461, -1.0, -0.8224637508392334]], "sft_index": 0}
